# 👋 Hi there, I'm Bakare Patience Omime
Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a passionate **Data Analyst and Educator** who enjoys making data easy to understand and using it to solve real-world and organizational problems.

## 🔍 About Me
My love for data led me to study **Mathematics and Economics** at the University, a combination that built a strong foundation in numbers, analysis, and decision-making. This background has helped me understand data deeply and apply it to practical situations.

## 💼 What I Do
I mainly work with **Microsoft Excel** and **Power BI** to:
- Design clean and insightful dashboards and reports  
- Clean, organize, and analyze data to find patterns and insights  
- Help individuals and organizations make better, data-informed decisions
  
I also have **beginner-level SQL skills**, and I’m continually improving as I work on new projects.

As both a learner and a teacher, I love breaking down complex data topics into simple, practical steps that others can follow and apply.
